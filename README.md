## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Run the Server Instance**  
   Start the server application first ‚Äî it will listen for incoming client connections.

2. **Launch the Client(s)**  
   For each client:

   - Enter the **server IP** (e.g., `127.0.0.1` for local testing).
   - Enter your **display name**.
   - Click **Join**.

3. **Start Chatting**
   - The joiner will be visible to all connected users.
   - Choose between **private**, **group**, or **broadcast** messaging.
